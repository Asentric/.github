## Asentric

**Mantle Security Realtime Alerting**

A lightweight, logs-based smart contract security monitoring system for Mantle Network, built for speed, clarity, and hackathon iteration.

---

## Overview

Asentric is an open-source, logs-based on-chain security monitoring system for the Mantle Network.

It ingests Ethereum event logs directly from Mantle RPC, normalizes them into structured security events, evaluates them using a rule engine, and publishes actionable alerts in near real-time.

The system is built as a hackathon-grade SDK and backend:

- Infrastructure and domain logic are strictly separated
- The watcher is reusable as a standalone SDK (`pkg/watcher`)
- Processor and dispatcher consume a clean domain model (`LogEvent`)
- The codebase is optimized for fast iteration and clarity, not long-term public API stability

---

## Why Logs-Based (Not Tx-Based)

Asentric intentionally uses event logs instead of full blocks or transaction-level execution.

**Rationale:**

- Mantle / OP Stack RPCs may return partial or pruned historical data
- `eth_getBlockByHash` and block re-fetch can be brittle on non-archive or shared RPCs
- Logs are:
  - Deterministic
  - Indexed
  - Cheap to query
  - Relatively stable across node implementations

**Design principle:**

> Security monitoring should observe protocol intent, not replay EVM execution.  
> Logs capture what actually happened at the protocol level.

---

## Architecture (Logs-Based)

High-level data flow:

```text
Watcher (Go, Infra-only)
    ├─ Subscribes to logs via SubscribeFilterLogs (WebSocket)
    ├─ Normalizes raw logs into LogEvent
    └─ Optionally publishes LogEvent to Redis Streams (stream:raw)

Processor (Go, Domain)
    ├─ Consumes LogEvent from Redis
    ├─ Resolves protocol metadata (registry)
    ├─ Applies rule heuristics
    ├─ Emits security alerts
    └─ Publishes to alert stream (stream:alerts)

Dispatcher (Go, Output)
    ├─ Consumes security alerts
    ├─ Formats messages
    └─ Sends to X / Webhook / other channels (mocked for MVP)
```

**Message Transport:** Redis Streams  
Used for ordered processing, replayability, and simple horizontal scaling via consumer groups.

## Core Design Principles (Hackathon SDK)

This project intentionally does **not** provide:

- Plugin ecosystems or extension marketplaces
- Dynamic loading of untrusted third-party code
- Long-term stable public APIs
- A complex configuration or deployment story

Instead, it focuses on:

- A small, readable Go codebase
- Clear boundaries between infra and domain logic
- A reference implementation that is easy to fork and modify

### Clear Separation of Concerns

| Layer      | Responsibility              |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Watcher   | Blockchain IO (logs only)   |
| Processor | Security reasoning / rules  |
| Dispatcher| Output & delivery           |
| Registry  | Metadata, not logic         |

No rule logic, protocol heuristics, or risk scoring live inside infrastructure code.

### Reusable Watcher

The watcher SDK:

- Emits generic `LogEvent` domain events
- Has zero knowledge of:
  - Protocols
  - Rules
  - Severity or risk models

This enables:

- Multiple processors reading from the same raw stream
- Parallel experimentation on rules without touching ingestion
- Reuse of the same watcher SDK across different apps or deployments

### Explicit SDK Scope

The Asentric SDK is meant to:

- Be understandable end-to-end during a hackathon
- Be forked and adapted, rather than imported as a black box
- Serve as a reference architecture for logs-based security monitoring

---

## Core Components

### Watcher Service (Logs-Based)

The watcher is a pure infrastructure service built around a small SDK in `pkg/watcher`.

**Key pieces:**

- `EventSource` interface for emitting `LogEvent`
- `LogsSource` implementation using `SubscribeFilterLogs`
- `StreamEngine` optional wrapper to publish `LogEvent` into Redis Streams

**Responsibilities:**

- Connect to Mantle RPC over WebSocket
- Subscribe to logs using address/topic filters
- Normalize `types.Log` into `domain.LogEvent`
- Optionally publish `LogEvent` into `stream:raw` via Redis Streams

**Does not:**

- Decode business meaning of events
- Apply rule logic or make risk decisions
- Know anything about specific protocols

### Processor Service (Rule Engine)

The processor consumes normalized events (`LogEvent`) and applies security heuristics.

**Responsibilities:**

- Convert Redis stream messages back into `LogEvent`
- Resolve protocol metadata via the registry
- Apply rule logic implemented as Go interfaces
- Emit security alerts when rules are triggered

Rules operate purely on:

- `domain.LogEvent` (normalized on-chain event)
- Optional `registry.ContractMeta` (context)

### Dispatcher Service

The dispatcher consumes alerts and forwards them to external channels.

**Responsibilities:**

- Consume alerts from `stream:alerts`
- Format messages for human consumption
- Send to X / Webhook / logging targets (mocked for MVP)

The dispatcher is intentionally simple and focused on output mechanics.

### Protocol Registry

A YAML-based metadata registry used only for enrichment.

**Stores:**

- Contract address → protocol name / tags
- Known event signatures
- Risk-related metadata
- Human-readable descriptions

The registry is not an execution engine; logic remains in the processor and rule code.

---

## Rule Engine (MVP Scope)

Rules are implemented as Go structs that satisfy a small interface (see `pkg/rules`).

**MVP rules focus on:**

- Large withdrawals or high-value transfers
- Unknown contract interactions
- Role / ownership changes (e.g., `grantRole`, `transferOwnership`)
- Contract upgrades (proxy events)
- Sensitive event detection based on known selectors

Rules consume only:

- `domain.LogEvent` (normalized event)
- Optional `registry.ContractMeta` (context)

---

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Go 1.22+
- **Blockchain:** Mantle Network (OP Stack)
- **Ethereum Client:** go-ethereum (via custom `pkg/client`)
- **Transport:** Redis Streams
- **Config:** YAML + environment variables (Viper)
- **Deployment:** Docker / Docker Compose (MVP)
- **Docs:** Separate `internal-docs` repository for internal architecture and operations
